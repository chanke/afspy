Structure of afspy

Configuration
=============

Config options are read as :
1. read system wide configuration file:
   Path is hard-coded in module
2. read user's personal $HOME/.config/afspy
3. read config file given on command line
4. use options given on command line

Later definitions overwrite earlier.
This configuration is stored in a AfsConfig-object.

An application has to initialize it and pass it on to
any service used.
Of course the application can modify AfsConfig beforehand.

# FixMe: we could store the default AfsConfig-Object in the module afs
# and use that if no config-object is given

DB-Cacheing
===========

If the option DB_CACHE is set to True.
A connection to the configured DB is set up 
and stored in the AfsConfig-Object.
Since every Service gets an AfsConfig-Object with a valid DB connection,
it just has to create a session and go on with its business.

Any Instance of a Model-Object has to be detached from the sqlalchemy-session, so it 
can be used as a normal object.
